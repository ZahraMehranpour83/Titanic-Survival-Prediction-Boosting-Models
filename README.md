# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Boosting-Models

ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This notebook demonstrates building, training, and evaluating boosting models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The workflow includes data loading, feature engineering, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, model training using gradient boosting (e.g., XGBoost / LightGBM / sklearn's GradientBoosting), model evaluation, and producing predictions for submission.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

1. Data Loading â€“ Load training and test datasets (CSV files such as train.csv and test.csv).


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Inspect distributions, missing values, and feature relationships with the target.


3. Feature Engineering â€“ Create useful features (e.g., Title from Name, FamilySize, IsAlone, Cabin presence).


4. Preprocessing â€“ Impute missing values (Age, Fare), encode categorical variables (One-Hot / Label encoding), and scale if necessary.


5. Modeling â€“ Train boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM, or sklearn GradientBoosting). Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.


6. Evaluation â€“ Evaluate using accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix, and cross-validation scores.


7. Prediction & Submission â€“ Create predictions on the test set and export submission CSV.

ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the titanic-boost.ipynb notebook.


2. Ensure train.csv and test.csv (Kaggle Titanic dataset) are available in the same folder or update paths accordingly.


3. Run all cells sequentially.


4. Review model evaluation outputs and the generated submission.csv file.

ðŸ“Š Outputs

Cross-validation scores and final test predictions.

Feature importance plot for the trained boosting model.

A submission.csv file with PassengerId and predicted Survived columns.

ðŸ§  Tips & Notes

Try different encoders and imputation strategies for robustness.

Use stratified K-fold CV when tuning hyperparameters to maintain class balance.

If using XGBoost or LightGBM, set random_state and n_jobs for reproducibility and speed.

Consider ensembling multiple boosting models to improve leaderboard performance.
